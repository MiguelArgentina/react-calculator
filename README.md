# Math-magicians calculator

## Objective

This project intends to give me my first steps into developing apps with react.

## Live link

Visit [Math-magicians calculator](https://react-tucu-calculator.herokuapp.com/).

## Features

Until now, the calculator displays all its objects (Display, ButtonPanel, Buttons) without styling, and now the  logic has been connected to the objects so they can handle events and interact with the user.
Also, the App class component has been transformed into a funcional component with a useState hook.
Additionally, the app takes care of bad routes requests with a "Not Found" webpage for the user and the quote is randomly served by an API request.


## Getting started

- To get started with the app, clone this project by running `git clone https://github.com/MiguelArgentina/react-calculator`
- cd into the directory and run `npm install` to install the needed packages and dependencies
- A development tool is included in the npm script. Run `npm start` to fire up a local server with live reloading.
- If not already redirected, visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to use the calculator.
- To terminate the server, enter `Ctrl + C` in your terminal


## Testing

- Running `npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## Building the app

- Running `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Built With

- Node.js
- React
- React-DOM
- React-Create-App
- Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app
- npm
