# Math-magicians calculator

## Objective

This project intends to give me my first steps into developing apps with react.

## Live link

Visit [Math-magicians calculator](https://react-tucu-calculator.herokuapp.com/).

## Features

Until now, the calculator displays all its objects (Display, ButtonPanel, Buttons) without styling.

## Getting started

- To get started with the app, clone this project by running `git clone https://github.com/MiguelArgentina/react-calculator`
- cd into the directory and run `npm install` to install the needed packages and dependencies
- A development tool is included in the npm script. Run `npm start` to fire up a local server with live reloading.
- If not already redirected, visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to use the calculator.
- To terminate the server, enter `Ctrl + C` in your terminal


## Testing

- Running `npm test` launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

## Building the app

- Running `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
